/**
 * The review conformance harness: one corpus, every consumer, the same answers.
 *
 * Import gates prove a consumer *may* use a shared primitive; they cannot prove it does.
 * This harness closes that gap. Each consumer of the shared review model registers an
 * adapter that projects a fixture into one normalized shape, and every adapter is checked
 * against the same hand-written expectations. A consumer that re-derives geometry instead
 * of consuming core fails here rather than drifting quietly
 * (`docs/browser-review-rebuild.md` § "Per-phase seam verification", rung 2).
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest:
 *
 * - Expectations are written **by hand from the semantics**, never captured from a
 *   primitive's output. A captured expectation follows a bug instead of catching it, and
 *   the adversarial fixtures exist precisely because the old copies got them wrong.
 * - The projection is renderer-neutral. Anything only one consumer can produce — rows,
 *   widths, DOM — stays out, or the corpus stops being comparable.
