/**
 * Rung 5 of the per-phase seam ladder: vocabulary and constant derivation.
 *
 * Import gates prove a module *may* use a shared definition; the conformance harness
 * proves consumers agree on answers. Neither catches the failure this suite exists for:
 * a wire schema that quietly stops covering the semantics it is supposed to carry, or
 * re-states a bound that already exists somewhere else
 * (`docs/browser-review-rebuild.md` § "Per-phase seam verification", rung 5).
 *
 * Two mechanical claims:
 *
 * - The wire action vocabulary **is** the intent vocabulary, so an intent added in a later
 *   phase becomes wire-reachable automatically and one deliberately withheld has to be
 *   subtracted by name and justified (`browser-review-seam-audit.md`, B12).
 * - Coupled constants are imported, not re-declared: no session module re-declares a name
 *   the shared review model already exports, no digest check is written as an inline
 *   pattern beside the shared validator, and the transport bound the browser-safe protocol
 *   deliberately does not import still accommodates it (D5).
 *
 * It lives in `scripts/` beside the boundary gate because it is the same kind of thing —
 * a mechanical check over the source tree — and is kept in its own file so the boundary
 * gate's tombstone and debt lists stay easy to audit.
