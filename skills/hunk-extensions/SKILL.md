name: hunk-extensions
description: Maps the `hunkdiff/extension` authoring surface for Hunk, the terminal diff viewer — hiding or reordering reviewed files, sidebar panes, alternate file views, commands and key bindings, dialogs, workspace writes, themes, syntax languages, VCS backends, lifecycle events. Use when writing, debugging, or installing a Hunk extension, or when a request asks Hunk itself to behave differently. Not for reviewing a diff in a live session — that is hunk-review.

# Building Hunk extensions

A Hunk extension is **one TypeScript (or JSX/JS) file that default-exports a
factory**. Hunk imports it at startup and hands it an API object. No build step,
no manifest required.

```ts
// ~/.config/hunk/extensions/hello.ts
import type { HunkExtensionAPI } from "hunkdiff/extension";

export default function (hunk: HunkExtensionAPI) {
  hunk.on("startup", (_event, ctx) => ctx.notify("Hello"));
}
```

This skill is a map of the touchpoints, not a recipe. Decide what to build from
the user's request; use the table below to find the call, then read the linked
material before writing code.

## Sources of truth — read before writing

| Source                                  | What it answers                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `docs/extensions.md`                    | The authoring guide. Every call, every rule. Start here.     |
| `src/extension-api/types.ts`            | The contract — exact field names, optionality, doc comments. |
| `examples/extensions/*`                 | Working extensions. Copy these patterns rather than invent.  |
| `docs/extension-architecture.md`        | Hunk's internals. Needed only when changing the host.        |
| `docs/keybindings.md`, `docs/themes.md` | Chord grammar and theme token rules that extensions inherit. |

Outside a Hunk checkout the guide is split across
<https://hunk.dev/docs/extend/extensions/> (discovery, trust, config) and its
companion pages — extension-api, file-previews, vcs-adapters, custom-sidebars —
and the contract ships as `node_modules/hunkdiff/dist/npm/extension/index.d.ts`.

The examples, by what they demonstrate:

- `review-triage/` — sidebar + commands + all three dialog shapes + lifecycle
  events + the extension event bus + a `useSyncExternalStore` bridge.
- `inline-edit/` — an interactive file-view `mode` driving `ctx.workspace` writes;
  its README explains the async lifetime rules better than anything else in tree.
- `rendered-markdown/` — a file view producing host-rendered rows from parsed
  Markdown, and a folder extension with an npm dependency.
- `jsx-file-view/`, `jsx-file-view-gallery/` — the experimental fixed-height JSX
  row component contract.

## Where extensions live

| Source                                     | Trust            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `--extension <path>` (repeatable)          | runs immediately |
| `[extensions] paths` in user config        | runs immediately |
| `~/.config/hunk/extensions/` (XDG-aware)   | runs immediately |
| `.hunk/extensions/` or repo-config `paths` | **trust prompt** |

Only the repo-local group is gated. Everything else — including `--extension`,
even when its path points inside the repository under review — is read as
explicit user intent and executes with full user permissions, no prompt. Never
pass or suggest a path you have not read, including one copied from a
repository's own README.

A directory matches `*.ts`/`*.tsx`/`*.js`/`*.jsx`/`*.mjs` at its top level, plus
one level of folder extensions. A folder is an extension if it has a
`package.json` with `{"hunk": {"extensions": ["./index.ts"]}}`, or an
`index.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs}`. Reach for a folder only when you need npm
dependencies, helper modules, or a README; a single file keeps the install to one
`cp`. Hunk never installs anything, so a folder extension's `node_modules` has to
exist on every machine that loads it — keep a repo-shared extension
dependency-free.

The **id** is the file stem, or the folder name for a folder extension — unless
its manifest declares several entries, in which case each entry is its own
extension named by its own stem (numeric suffix on collision). The id is the
namespace it owns: commands are `<id>.<commandId>`, sidebar views
`<id>:<viewId>`, config `[extension.<id>]`. Ids match
`/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$/`; `hunk`, `arc`, `git`, `jj`, and `sl` are reserved. A
bad or duplicate id is skipped with a startup notice.

## Pick the touchpoint

| To do this                                              | Call                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Add a selectable color theme                            | `hunk.registerTheme(theme)`                  |
| Highlight an unrecognized file extension                | `hunk.registerFileLanguage(ext, lang)`       |
| Support another VCS (`git`/`jj`/`sl` are reserved)      | `hunk.registerVcsAdapter(adapter)`           |
| Add a navigation/list/status pane beside the review     | `hunk.registerSidebarView(view)`             |
| Present a file as something other than a raw diff       | `hunk.registerFileView(view)` (experimental) |
| Bind a key / add an Extensions-menu entry               | `hunk.registerCommand(command, handler)`     |
| Hide, reorder, retitle files before review              | `hunk.transformChangeset(fn)`                |
| React to loads, selection, viewed files, notes, reloads | `hunk.on(event, handler)`                    |
| Coordinate with another loaded extension                | `hunk.events.emit` / `hunk.events.on`        |
| Read user-supplied settings                             | `hunk.config` (`[extension.<id>]` table)     |
| Branch on the API generation (currently `3`)            | `hunk.apiVersion`                            |

Registration is only valid while the factory runs — Hunk seals the API object
afterwards.

## What handlers receive

Every event, bus, command, and file-view mode handler — plus every changeset
transform — gets `ctx.cwd` and `ctx.notify(message, type?)`. A file view's
`matches` and `layout` get no context at all. Beyond that:

- **Event and bus handlers** also get `ctx.sidebars` (open/close/toggle/isOpen on
  any view) and `ctx.events.emit`.
- **Command handlers** get `ctx.sidebars`, `ctx.fileViews` (select/toggle/isActive/
  refresh/enterMode/exitMode), `ctx.selection` (a snapshot of file + hunk index),
  `ctx.navigation` (live, guarded `selectFile`/`selectHunk`), `ctx.commands`
  (`isEnabled`/`execute` for public semantic `hunk.*` commands), `ctx.dialogs`
  (`confirm`/`select`/`input`, queued and attributed), and `ctx.workspace`
  (`readDocument`, `canWriteDocument`, `writeDocument` with consent).
- **Sidebar components** get props: `files` (frozen, filtered, review order, each
  with `hunks` summaries), `selectedFileId`, `selectedHunkIndex`, `width`,
  `theme` (hex tokens plus an `appearance` flag — see `ExtensionPaintTheme`),
  `keybindings` (ask by command id, never hard-code a chord), and `actions`
  (`selectFile`, `selectHunk`, `notify`).
- **File-view `layout`** gets `file`, `width`, `signal`, `changes`, and a lazy
  `readDocument(side)`.
- **File-view `mode` handlers** get `ctx.file` and `ctx.fileViews`. `onKey` must
  answer **synchronously** — its return value (`"handled"`/`"pass"`/`"exit"`) is
  the routing decision, so kick off async work and report it later through
  `notify` or `refresh`. Escape is host-owned and never reaches `onKey`.

Event payloads, sidebar props, and a command's selection all hand you frozen
`ExtensionDiffFile` / `ExtensionDiffHunk` views. A changeset transform is the
exception: it receives the live changeset and is expected to return a new one.
`metadata` is unfrozen either way — it is the renderer's parsed diff, so pass it
through untouched.

## Rules that bite

Most extension bugs are one of these:

- **Registering a surface does not show it.** A sidebar view starts closed unless
  it declares `defaultOpen` (or `replacesDefault`, which starts open in place of
  the built-in file list). A file view never activates itself — raw diff is the
  default and the user picks the view from the **View** menu. Ship a command that
  toggles it and say which key, or correct code looks like it did nothing.
- **A rejected file-view layout silently becomes raw diff.** `hunkRows` needs one
  in-bounds, inclusive entry per parsed hunk at the same array index, and
  `sourceRanges` may not overlap on a side; invalid, oversized, cancelled, and
  throwing layouts warn once and fall back.
- **Never bundle or vendor React.** Hunk serves its own `react` and `@opentui/*`
  to extension files; a second copy means a second hooks dispatcher and the
  component fails to render. Import them normally. OpenTUI intrinsics (`box`,
  `text`, `scrollbox`) need no import.
- **`layout` is a pure derivation of `(file, width)`.** A stateful view keeps
  painting its first answer until `ctx.fileViews.refresh(viewId)` — scope it with
  `{ fileId }` when the state belongs to one file.
- **Handler state must live outside the component.** Panes unmount when closed;
  bridge module-level state into React with `useSyncExternalStore` and immutable
  snapshots (`review-triage/index.tsx` is the working version).
- **A reload keeps your factory and renames the files.** Factories re-run only
  after a trust grant or a cwd change, so module state survives — but a file's
  `id` encodes its position in the changeset, so a reload that adds or drops a
  file renumbers the rest. Key durable per-file state by `path`, or reconcile it
  on `changeset_loaded`. Pick one deliberately.
- **Transforms must preserve `metadata`** (spreading a file does), keep ids
  unique, and return a real changeset — otherwise the transform is skipped with a
  warning and the previous changeset carries forward.
- **Chords are defaults.** Users remap by command id in `[keybindings]`; built-ins
  win conflicts, refused one chord at a time. Bind the character shift produces
  (`"!"`, not `"shift+1"`).
- **`ctx.commands` invokes Hunk, not other extensions.** Probe with
  `isEnabled("hunk.review.nextHunk")`, then call `execute(id, { count })` for an
  explicitly public built-in. Counts are positive whole numbers up to 10,000,
  applied atomically to movement; one-shot actions run once. Unknown, disabled,
  private, extension-owned, or stale commands return `false`.
- **Repo config can set `[extension.<id>]` for a globally installed extension.**
  Treat `hunk.config` as untrusted for anything exec-adjacent (binary paths,
  shell commands, module loading).
- **`ctx.workspace` writes only apply to reloadable, unstaged working-tree
  reviews**, by reviewed file id, inside the review root, with consent. Everything
  else returns `{ ok: false, reason }` — check `canWriteDocument` first.
- **File-view note placement is all-or-raw per file**: an unbound or range-less
  visible note makes Hunk render the complete raw diff instead of guessing.
- **Failures are contained, not sandboxed.** A throwing factory is rolled back to
  zero registrations and a throwing handler is a warning naming the extension —
  containment against bugs, not against code that should not have been loaded.
- **The API touches nothing outside the review.** No clipboard, no filesystem, no
  process surface beyond `ctx.workspace` — an extension is ordinary code, so shell
  out for the rest. Never write to stdout: the renderer owns it. For the same
  reason `hunk.log` is collected as diagnostics and printed nowhere; `ctx.notify`
  is how a user hears from you.
- **`HunkExtensionUserError`** (detected structurally by `name`) buys the full
  treatment — message plus `suggestions`, no stack trace — only from a VCS adapter
  operation, which is where Hunk formats it for the CLI. From a command or event
  handler only the message survives, as a warning toast.

## Verifying

Hunk's TUI needs a real terminal, and the review UI is the user's — **do not
launch `hunk diff`/`hunk show` to test, and do not reach for a pipe.** No
invocation applies extensions headlessly: `hunk diff … | cat` still starts the
app and still takes the keyboard, so it hangs holding the user's terminal.
Practical checks, in order of cost:

1. **Typecheck.** In a checkout, `bun run typecheck` covers
   `examples/extensions/**` via the `hunkdiff/extension` path mapping. Standalone,
   add `hunkdiff` as a dev dependency and run `tsc --noEmit`; for a `.tsx`
   extension also add `react`, `@types/react` (React ships no declarations of its
   own), `@opentui/core`, and `@opentui/react` as **dev** dependencies and set
   `"jsx": "react-jsx"` with
   `"jsxImportSource": "@opentui/react"`, or every `<box>` and `<text>` is an
   untyped intrinsic. Types only — shipping those packages is the second-React bug.
2. **Unit-test the logic.** When parsing, matching, or formatting is worth
   testing, put it in helper modules with plain `bun test` coverage.
3. **PTY integration.** In a checkout, `test/pty/extensions-integration.test.ts`
   launches Hunk over a PTY with `--extension <path>` and asserts on rendered
   snapshots; extend it via `test/pty/harness.ts` and run `bun run test:integration`.
4. **Hand it to the user** to run: `hunk diff --extension ./my-ext`. `--extension`
   loads immediately with no trust prompt, so it is the iteration path. Ask them
   what the footer notices and toasts said.
5. **Triage with `--no-extensions`** to confirm a symptom belongs to an extension
   (bundled VCS backends and the built-in sidebar stay loaded either way).

## If it does not load

- No startup notice at all → a successful load is silent, so either it loaded and
  nothing opened it, or discovery never saw the file. Check the directory, the
  entry suffix, or the folder's `package.json` `hunk.extensions` paths.
- Notice naming the extension → id rejected (reserved, malformed, or already
  claimed), import failure, missing default export, or a throwing factory.
- Repo-local extension silently absent → the trust prompt was dismissed or denied;
  decisions are stored per repo root in `~/.config/hunk/state.json`.
- Sidebar pane closes with a toast → the component threw; a second React copy is
  the usual cause.
- Sidebar or file view never appears → nothing opened it (no `defaultOpen`, no
  command), `matches` returned false, or the layout was rejected.
- Command never fires → its chord lost to a built-in or an earlier extension (a
  warning says so); it is still reachable from the **Extensions** menu and
  bindable by `<id>.<commandId>`.

## Changing Hunk itself

Only when the work is in the `hunk` repo rather than in a user extension:

- Shipped VCS backends and the built-in sidebar are **bundled extensions** in
  `src/extensions/default/`, registering through the same public API. That
  dogfooding is deliberate — if the public contract cannot express something,
  that is a real gap, not a reason for a private path. `default/vcs/` loads from
  VCS adapter resolution and must stay renderer-free.
- `src/extension-api/types.ts` must stay **import-free**; declaration emission
  publishes whatever it reaches, and `scripts/check-pack.ts` fails the pack
  otherwise. Shapes shared with internal code are declared there and re-exported
  inward.
- New API surface means updating `docs/extensions.md` (its examples are
  typechecked as consumer code), the matching hand-written page under
  `website/src/content/docs/docs/extend/` (only `cli.md` and `config.md` are
  generated), `docs/extension-architecture.md` if ownership moves, and a changeset.
- `AGENTS.md` and `docs/extension-architecture.md` own the rest of these rules.
