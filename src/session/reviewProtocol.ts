/**
 * The review wire schema: what one review consumer may say to the producer serving it.
 *
 * Everything here is a description of a message, never a decision about a review. The
 * semantics live in `src/core/review/` and are reached by *deriving* from them rather
 * than restating them:
 *
 * - **The action vocabulary is `ReviewIntent`.** The prototype hand-copied that union
 *   into a wire type, a capability list, and a validator, so an intent added to one was
 *   silently unreachable from the others (`docs/browser-review-seam-audit.md`, B12).
 *   Here the vocabulary *is* `REVIEW_INTENT_TYPES`, and each action's payload is the
 *   intent's own shape plus the few fields only a remote caller needs.
 * - **Validation is the shared validators.** Exact-key checking is `hasExactKeys`; digests
 *   are `isReviewSha256Digest`; note size is core's `reviewNoteWithinSizeLimit`, measured once
 *   over the whole note (D1); the resource read request and chunk are core's own types
 *   (D5). This module declares no digest regex, no second byte measurement, and no copy
 *   of a bound that exists elsewhere.
 * - **Nothing is re-derived.** A caller addressing a line inside an expanded gap sends
 *   the proof it holds (B10); the producer resolves it through `resolveReviewExpandedLine`
 *   and the shared anchor path. The wire never computes hunk intersections or ownership
 *   (D3).
 *
 * The module is browser-safe by construction and gated as such: it imports from
 * `src/core/review/` and nothing else — no Node builtins, no broker package, no
 * transport. `scripts/source-boundaries.test.ts` enforces that, and the transport-side
 * couplings it deliberately does not import (frame sizes) are asserted against this
 * module's own bounds in `scripts/review-vocabulary.test.ts`.
