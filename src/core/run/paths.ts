 * 8.3 short name or a differently cased drive letter on Windows — and plain
 * `resolve` preserves every one of those spellings, so two layers that both

 * directory. `realpathSync.native` collapses all of them to the form the OS
 * itself reports, which is also the form Git's `--show-toplevel` prints.
