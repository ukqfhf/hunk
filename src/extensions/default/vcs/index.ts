/**
 * The bundled extension tier.
 *
 * Every VCS backend Hunk ships — Arc, Git, Jujutsu, Sapling — is an extension,
 * registered through the same `registerVcsAdapter` a third-party author calls.
 * There are no core-registered adapters left, which is the point: a capability
 * Hunk ships on cannot quietly outgrow the API it publishes, and Git is the
 * backend that exercises every integration point there is.
 *
 * Three things separate this tier from user extensions:
 *
 * - The factories are **statically imported**, so they compile into the binary
 *   and load synchronously. Adapter resolution happens during config
 *   resolution, long before the async user-extension pass, and the session's
 *   backend has to be there for it.
 * - They are **implicitly trusted**: they are Hunk's own code, so there is no
 *   discovery, no trust prompt, and no `[extension.<id>]` config table.
 * - They stay loaded under `--no-extensions` and `[extensions] enabled =
 *   false`. Those switches exist to triage *user* extensions; losing VCS
 *   support from a debugging flag would break every workflow there is.
 *
 * Failure isolation still applies — a throwing factory becomes a load issue
 * rather than a crash — even though these factories are Hunk's own and that
 * path should be unreachable.
 *
 * VCS backends are the only registration kind this tier uses today, and the
 * only one consumed from here (`src/core/vcs` reads `getBundledVcsAdapters`).
 * A bundled extension that registered a theme or a changeset transform would
 * also have to be threaded through `applyExtensionRegistrations`, which today
 * only sees the user-extension load result.
