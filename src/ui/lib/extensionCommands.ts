 * Adapt registered extension commands into dispatch-table entries.

 * A chord that collides with a built-in shortcut — or with an earlier
 * extension's binding — is refused and reported, never silently shadowed:
 * built-ins keep every key they hold, and between extensions load order is the
 * tiebreaker, same as everywhere else in the registry. Conflicts are detected
 * by synthesizing the key event a chord describes and probing every matcher,
 * because a command may match with a predicate rather than chords. Refusal is
 * per chord, not per command: a command bound to three keys, one of them taken,
 * keeps the other two and reports the one it lost. Modal surfaces still own
 * their keys outright, so a dialog or an open menu answers before any command.
 *
 * Every registered command becomes a table entry, including one left with no
 * chord at all: it never matches a key, but it is still listed in the
 * Extensions menu and still runnable by id from there.
