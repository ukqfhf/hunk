Press `?` at any time for Hunk's in-app shortcut reference. Menus and primary review actions are also mouse-selectable.

## Navigate the review

| Keys                      | Action                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `↑` / `↓`, `k` / `j`      | Scroll one row                                        |
| `Space` / `f`, `b`        | Page down / up                                        |
| `Shift+Space`             | Page up                                               |
| `d` / `u`                 | Half page down / up                                   |
| `[` / `]`                 | Previous / next hunk                                  |
| `,` / `.`                 | Previous / next file                                  |
| `{` / `}`                 | Previous / next annotated hunk                        |
| `Home` / `End`, `g` / `G` | Start / end of review                                 |
| `←` / `→`                 | Scroll unwrapped code; hold Shift for faster movement |

Hunk navigation stays review-wide: hunk and file shortcuts move through the same multi-file stream shown in the main pane.

`↑` / `↓` and `k` / `j` move a highlighted current line, and the view scrolls only far enough to keep it visible. Paging or scrolling past it moves it to the nearest line still on screen, and `c` anchors a note on it. Pick the marker from the View menu, or set [`cursor_line`](/docs/configure/layout-and-display/): `number` marks only the line number, and `off` turns the marker off and lets `↑` / `↓` and `k` / `j` scroll the view one row at a time instead.

## Change the view

| `q`             | Quit                                             |

Hunk may offer to save view changes on quit. Saving writes personal preferences globally unless the repository already has a `.hunk/config.toml`.

## Add a human note

Press `c` on the selected hunk or use a visible add-note affordance with the mouse. While editing, app shortcuts are suspended so normal text entry works. Save with the note editor's displayed action or cancel with Escape.

## Mouse behavior

- Click a sidebar file to jump to it in the review stream.
- Click menus and dialog actions instead of their key equivalents.
- Use the wheel or scrollbar to move through the review; hold Shift while scrolling to move horizontally through unwrapped code.
- Select diff text for copy where the terminal supports it.

## Remap the defaults

Every shortcut above is a named command you can move to different keys with a `[keybindings]` table in your user config. See [Keybindings](/docs/configure/keybindings/).

Terminal mouse protocols vary; see [terminal compatibility](/docs/help/compatibility/) if clicks or selection do not behave as expected.
